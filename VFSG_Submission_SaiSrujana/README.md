Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sai Srujana Gunda, a first-timer to participate in VFSG competitions.
I used R for my analysis and visualizations.

## My Analysis

I tried to analyze the engagement rate of VFSG in three ways - volunteer engagement, LinkedIn statistics and Twitter.

### Volunteer Engagement

- I have observed that the projects have a good impact on the engagement rate.
- To understand how many projects VFSG has actually conducted and the Goals it concentrates on, I adopted a pie chart. It is helpful to understand how many Charities/Projects are released with respect to the goal.

- That said, the volunteers who participated in these competetions were also in my analysis (and I understood that there is a slight drop in the last two years)

### LinkedIn Stats

- We can say that LinkedIn is one of the best ways to get the volunteers from. To check how VFSG has spread it's influence across the world, I used the LinkedIn Stats.

### Twitter Stats

- The Twitter statistics show there is a tremendous increase in the number of *Views* in the year *2023*
- The other are compared here:
